# 3D Physics Engine

## Overview

This project is a 3D physics engine implemented using C++ and OpenGL. The engine focuses on the simulation of rigid bodies and is designed to provide accurate and efficient physics computations for a variety of applications, including games and simulations.

## Features

- **Rigid Body Simulation:** Accurate simulation of rigid bodies, including collision detection and response.
- **Real-Time Rendering:** Utilizes OpenGL for real-time rendering of 3D objects.
- **Interactive Controls:** Allows for user interaction with the simulation, including the ability to manipulate objects and adjust physics parameters.
- **Extensible Framework:** Modular design that allows for easy extension and customization.
- **Performance Optimization:** Efficient algorithms to ensure smooth performance even with complex scenes.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- CMake for building the project

## Usage
### Controls
 
 - W/A/S/D: Move the camera
 - Mouse: Rotate the camera
 - Space: Apply a force to the selected object
 - R: Reset the simulation

### Adjusting Physics Parameters

 - You can adjust various physics parameters in the configuration file (config.ini). Parameters include gravity, mass of objects, and coefficients of restitution.
